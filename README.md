**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Axel Siliezar**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/site-light-sound?path=README.md%3A9%3A81

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
I could change the overall design as I belive the interaction could be more modern and more appealing

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I mostly used the previous knowledge in javascript, html and css that I had. For the random number I used the Javascript documentation provided by mozila in the following link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I think my personal challenge was to operate in glitch.com as it was the first time. However, it was easily overcomed as it felt like any other IDE. The rest of the submission was not too challenging and I was able to enjoy the activity. Probably a challenging part was the random array that had to be created with Math.random(), however, it was incredibly interesting to develop. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would like to experience more with backend development and I think some questions would rise as, how similar it is connecting APIs in web development to mobile development? I am currently taking iOS Development course and that was one of my favorite features. I wanted to ask if the way of connecting a database with a web application is similar in any matter?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would definitely try to work more on the User interface to make it more attractive to users. I would also love to follor a set theme, for example, I could do like a rocket and the user is an austronaut trying to defuse a bomb and follow a pattern. I believe this would have made it so much more fun since the user would feel like the game has higher stakes and is more interactive.
